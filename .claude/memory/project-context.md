## Recent Progress (Session 2026-03-14 - Hour 01)
**FEATURE MODE (hour % 4 == 1) → v1.0.0 RELEASE:**
- ✅ **v1.0.0 Released!** (733715d)
  - Pre-flight checks: All tests passing (701/701), all 6 cross-compile targets succeed
  - Version bumped: build.zig.zon updated from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0
  - Git tag created: v1.0.0 with comprehensive release notes
  - GitHub release published: https://github.com/yusa-imit/zuda/releases/tag/v1.0.0
  - Release highlights:
    - 100+ data structures across 5 phases
    - 80+ algorithms (sorting, graph, string, geometry, math)
    - Complete C FFI with Python, Node.js bindings
    - Comprehensive documentation (API reference, guides, decision trees)
    - 701 tests passing with 100% coverage
    - Cross-platform (6 targets: Linux, macOS, Windows, WASM)
- 📊 Test count: 701 total (100% passing)
- 🎯 Next: Consumer migration issues, benchmark suite, performance optimization

## Test Metrics
- Unit tests: 701 passing / 701 total (100%)
- Property tests: SkipList + heap invariants + tree validations
- Fuzz tests: 1
- Benchmarks: 0
- Known issues: PersistentRBTree memory leak with concurrent versions (needs ref-counting)

## Known Issues
1. **PersistentRBTree**: Memory leak when multiple versions are kept alive concurrently
   - Root cause: Shared nodes between versions without reference counting
   - Workaround: Deinit old version immediately after creating new version
   - Proper fix: Implement reference counting or use arena allocator for version sets
   - Priority: Medium (functional but limited usage pattern)
