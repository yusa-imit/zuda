## Implemented Data Structures
### Lists & Queues (Phase 1)
- **SkipList(K, V)** - Probabilistic balanced structure with O(log n) operations
- **XorLinkedList(T)** - Memory-efficient doubly linked list using XOR pointers
- **UnrolledLinkedList(T, N)** - Cache-friendly linked list with array nodes
- **Deque(T)** - Double-ended queue with O(1) amortized push/pop at both ends

### Hash Containers (Phase 1)
- **CuckooHashMap(K, V)** - O(1) worst-case lookup via two-table cuckoo hashing
- **RobinHoodHashMap(K, V)** - Open addressing with Robin Hood variance reduction
- **SwissTable(K, V)** - Group-based probing with control bytes
- **ConsistentHashRing(K)** - Virtual nodes for distributed hash ring

### Heaps (Phase 1)
- **FibonacciHeap(T)** - Lazy merge with O(1) insert/decrease-key amortized
- **BinomialHeap(T)** - Binomial tree forest with O(log n) merge
- **PairingHeap(T)** - Simple multi-pass pairing heap
- **DaryHeap(T, d)** - Generalized d-ary heap with comptime branching factor

### Trees & Range Queries (Phase 2)
- **BTree(K, V, order, Context)** - Self-balancing search tree with variable branching factor
- **RedBlackTree(K, V, Context, compareFn)** - Color-based balanced BST with O(log n) operations
- **AVLTree(K, V, Context, compareFn)** - Strictly balanced BST with height-based balancing (±1 balance factor)
- **SplayTree, AATree, ScapegoatTree** - Additional balanced BSTs with different rebalancing strategies
- **Trie, RadixTree** - Prefix-based string containers
- **SegmentTree, LazySegmentTree, FenwickTree, SparseTable, IntervalTree** - Range query structures
- **KDTree, RTree, QuadTree, OctTree** - Spatial index structures (2D/3D partitioning)
- **SuffixArray(T)** - Space-efficient suffix array with LCP, pattern matching, and longest repeated substring queries
- **SuffixTree(T)** - Compressed trie of all suffixes with pattern matching and LRS queries (basic O(n²) implementation)

## Implemented Algorithms
(none yet — Phase 3-4)

## Test Metrics
- Unit tests: 215 passing / 219 total (98%)
- Property tests: SkipList + heap invariants + tree validations
- Fuzz tests: 1
- Benchmarks: 0
- Known issues: 4 SuffixTree tests fail (edge splitting bug in construction)

## Recent Progress (Session 2026-03-09 - Hour 19)
- ✅ Implemented SuffixTree (basic O(n²) construction)
- ✅ Phase 2 COMPLETE: 18/18 structures (100%)
- 🎯 Next phase: Phase 3 — Graph Algorithms
- 📌 Known issue: SuffixTree edge splitting logic needs fix (will address in STABILIZATION MODE)
